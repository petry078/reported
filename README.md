Just sit and write.

It works really fast, it is just a few lines of code.

Text is stored on client browser with JavaScript localStorage property.

Can be used with Grammarly, LanguageTool and others browser spell checkers.

## Future work

* The green ligt at the top will blink red while the client is typing and when the text is not yet saved.
